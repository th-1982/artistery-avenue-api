# Artistery Avenue API
"Artisery Avenue Api" is the backend service used by the [Artistery Avenue](https://) platform.
The deployed DjangoRESTFramework API can be found [here](https://th-1982-artistery-avenue-198c22334f81.herokuapp.com/)

# Purpose of the API:
To serve as the backend infrastructure for the front end by posting  (POST) and retrieving (GET) data from endpoints and performing create, read, update, and delete operations on objects users enter via the front end. 

## Planning & Agile:
This [project]() was planned and developed using Agile methodology.

For this purpose, the project was illustrated by [10 initial Milestone](http://) entitled "Profiles", "Posts", "Likes", "Comments", "Followers", "Reviews", "Walls", "Artist", "Contacts" and "Bookmarks" providing the developer with the freedom to accomplish all issues/tasks flexibly before dates deadline set to March. The Milestones were broken according to their component's names.

Throughout the development process, new milestones were added, where tasks started from "Todo," progressing to "In Progress," and finally "Done." The issues were assigned to the sole developer and labeled as "could-have," "should-have," "must-have," and "won't-have".
